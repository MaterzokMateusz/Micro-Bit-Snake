# Micro-Bit-Snake

This is my first project in MicroPython for BBC Micro:bit.

Playfield will be 5x5 px (whole screen).
Fruits will be randomly generated and placed on screen.
There will be no walls on the edges of the screen
Eating fruit will create new body segment in baby state - eating 3 fruits will make segment mature and next eaten fruit will make next baby body segment.
State of segments will be displayed by the LED light intensity
